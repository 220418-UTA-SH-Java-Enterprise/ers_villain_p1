### **SCRUM 2: 05/10/22**
> ##### _**Levi:** This first meeting summary will be a bit short... I'll take better notes for the future._
<br>

**Issues resolved:**
- [x] Connecting AWS to DBeaver
- [x] Git/GitHub sync

<br>

**Team Decisions:**
- [x] Using Hibernate 

<br>

**Scrum 2 Milestone/Tasks:**
- [ ] Reviewing Hibernate
- [ ] Completing assigned Model & Repository Layers 
- [ ] Starting on Services layer
- [ ] Unit Testing 
- [ ] Remember to review each others' code and push your work to your respective branch!

<br>

**Review**: The Service Layer calls what we specified in the Data Layer and adds business logic to it. This is where you would consider input validation, etc. 
- This layer will in turn be called on by the Controller layer.
